    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I'm working towards becoming a dental hygienist and a real estate agent and the stuff that makes me wanna purse those dreams are I wanna be wealthy and I want to have no money problems in the future. I also wanna be my own boss I don't like when people tell me what to do so I don't have to worry about that when I'm a real estate agent. The way I'm gonna work towards my goals is by going to dental school and while I'm at college I'm gonna be learning about houses and real estates and I'm gonna get in connection with a couple of people that already do real estate and get help with me to get me stared. Values that's going to most necessary is me being patience cause I wont get wealthy over one night and I'm gonna need to be more responsibly as I get older. Short term goals that I wish to accomplish in the near future is to have more knowledge on real estate and to to focused on school next year. Character traits and achievements that I wanna be most known for is a trustworthy person cause you cant trust anyone and me being known for that help's me with other people and a dependable person that can be trusted with. </p>
